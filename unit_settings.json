See you Monday 1pm in Warren Lecture Hall 2001. Notes for class are linked below: we recommend attending class in person each day (if you can). We'll be working directly on quiz and homework questions in many classes to help you get started with problem solving. Discussion sections will include a review of the lecture material for the week and example problems. They are scheduled for Wednesdays at 5pm in YORK 2722. Tests will be taken in class twice during the quarter.",
