# This program creates dictionary that matches
# outcomes to weeks in which they are discussed and then
# produces .tex files for each outcome
# with snippets ordered chronologically by weeks
#
# Input: outcomes.json specifies all outcomes
# website-settings are global settings (ungrouped snippets)
# unit_settings.json helps find the order of the weeks each snippet appears in

#Output: compiled .tex files for each outcome with corresponding snippets
