    <h1 style="margin-top: 100px;">Theory of Computation
    </h1>
    <h2>CSE105Sp22</h2>
    <p>Is there a problem that NO computer can ever solve?<br>

      What resources are needed to solve a problem?<br>
      
      Are some problems harder than others? <br></p>
    <p>In this course, we will explore what it means to be "computable". We begin with a very simple model of
      computation, and work our way to the most powerful, the Turing machine, named after 
      <a href= "http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/people/alan_turing">Alan Turing</a>, 
      who formalized the notion of "algorithm" <i>even before there were any physical computers</i>.
      You'll also learn about the relationship of these models to some essential tools in a computer 
      scientist's toolkit, such as regular expressions and context-free grammars. Finally, you'll develop 
      your technical communication skills in writing formal arguments and proofs. 
    </p>
    <p>Use our <a href="overview_calendar.html" aria-label="Go to Calendar">Calendar</a> to get links to
      class times and notes. Submit your work for this class on
      <a href="http://gradescope.com" aria-label="Go to Gradescope" target="_blank">Gradescope</a>.
      Reach out to me (minnes@eng.ucsd.edu) or one of the other
      <a href="courseInfo.html#team" aria-label="Contact a team member">CSE 105 team members</a>
      if you have questions.
      This term we will be using Piazza for class discussion; find our class page
      <a href="https://piazza.com/ucsd/spring2022/cse105/home" aria-label="Go to Piazza">on Piazza</a>; 
      one thing Piazza is particularly good for is finding homework group mates. Some of the homework in 
      this class will be group-work optional; students in previous versions of the class often found group
      conversations helped them learn the material more deeply, and were fun.

  <!-- Syllabus -->
  <div class="row" style="margin-left: 5%;margin-right: 5%;">
    <h2>Syllabus</h2>
    <p>Here are our plans for CSE 105 this quarter, keeping in mind we may need to be flexible
      in response to campus and public health guidance.
    </p>
    <ul style="margin-left: 4%; font-size:150%;">
      <li>We will provide all required material for this class on this website. Lecture
        material is available in PDF, tex, and html formats so you can download and annotate or print
        it if you'd like. In class, we'll explore concepts and work through examples.
        Sometimes, we'll think through
        multiple choice questions individually or in small groups so you can
        test and deepen your understanding.
        Other examples will be open-ended problems to practice the critical thinking and communication
        skills we are developing in CSE 105.</li>
      <li>Lectures are scheduled for MWF 9am-9:50pm. Please fill out the pre-class survey
        that was sent to your @ucsd.edu email so that we can learn about your preferences
        and needs for this quarter; you can also find a link to your survey on our
        <a href="http://canvas.ucsd.edu" aria-label="Go to Canvas" target="_blank">Canvas</a> page.
        Lectures will be recorded and posted on <a href="http://podcast.ucsd.edu" target="_blank">
          podcast.ucsd.edu</a>, and linked from 
        <a href="overview_calendar.html" aria-label="Go to Calendar">Calendar</a>.
      </li>
      <li>Review quizzes based on class material are assigned each day. These quizzes will help you
        track and confirm your understanding of the concepts and examples we work in class.
        Quizzes can be submitted on Gradescope as many times (with no penalty) as you like until the quiz deadline:
        the three quizzes each week are all due on Friday (with no penalty late submission open until Sunday). </li>
      <li>We maintain a <a href="overview_calendar.html#officehours">calendar of drop-in help hours</a>: check each listing to
        see whether the drop-in help hours session is offered in-person or remote. Location or Zoom link
        will be in the event description. You can also reach out to me directly by email: minnes@eng.ucsd.edu .
        <em>I'm happy for you to address me as Prof. Minnes, Dr. Minnes,
          and/or Mia. My pronouns are she/her/hers. Please do not use the title Ms./ Mrs. for me</em>.
      </li>
      <li>Discussion sections will include a review
        of the lecture material for the week and example problems. They are
        scheduled for Wednesdays 5pm-5:50pm in Galbraith 242.</li>
      <li>We learn by doing: your primary out-of-class work for this class will be weekly
        homework assignments and a project, along with a final exam. These assessments will
        be your opportunity to practice using precise tools to represent and solve technical
        problems and to communicate your solutions.

    <h2>Resources</h2>

    <p>We encourage you to work on homework in groups of up to three CSE 105 classmates. To find group members: reach out
      to
      people sitting around you in class, in discussion section, or during office hours. The pre-survey
      also asks if you want help finding group members: the CSE 105 instructional team can help you connect with
      other students. Working within the campus safety guidelines, you may choose to meet with your
      group mates in person (find ideas for
      <a href="https://students.ucsd.edu/campus-services/technology/campus-study-locations.html" target="_blank" )>
        where to study on campus</a>), or online. If you're working with one another remotely, we highly recommend
      meeting synchronously so that you can work through the homework problems *together*. Your @ucsd.edu account
      gives you access to Zoom, login at <a href="https://ucsd.zoom.us/" aria-label="Go to UCSD Zoom login page"
        target="_blank">https://ucsd.zoom.us/</a> to schedule a meeting. Pro tip:
      if you change the meeting URL from https://ucsd.zoom.us/j/MEETING-ID to
      https://ucsd.zoom/us/wc/join/MEETING-ID, it will allow the user to join via the browser
      and not just through the app. The <a href="https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/categories/200101697"
        target="_blank">Zoom support page</a> has details on hosting and joining meetings.
    </p>

    <h3>Textbook and supplies</h3>

    <p>
      We will provide all required material for this class on this website. 
      There is no required textbook for this class. Lecture
      material is available in PDF and html formats so you can download and annotate or print
      it if you'd like. In class, we'll work through examples. Some of these examples
      will have multiple choice questions so you can test and deepen your understanding.
      Other examples will be open-ended problems to practice the critical thinking and communication
      skills we are developing in CSE 105.
    </p>

    <p> Previous versions of the course used reference textbooks, including
      <em>Discrete Mathematics and its Applications</em> by Kenneth Rosen, which
      has <a href="http://highered.mheducation.com/sites/0073383090/student_view0">online
        self-assessments and extra examples</a>.</li>
    </p>

    <h3>Typesetting (LaTeX) Resources</h3>
    <p>All submitted homework for this class must be typed. Diagrams may be hand-drawn and
      scanned and included in the typed document. You can use a word processing editor if you
      like (Microsoft Word, Open Office, Notepad, Vim, Google Docs, etc.) but you might
      find it useful to take this opportunity to learn LaTeX. LaTeX is a markup language used
      widely in computer science and mathematics. The homework assignments are typed using LaTeX
      and you can use the source files as templates for typesetting your solutions.</p>

    <p>If you have never used LaTeX, we recommend cloud resources
      that don't require you to download and install LaTeX on your local machine.
      A good example is <a href="https://www.overleaf.com/" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to Overleaf">Overleaf</a>,
      which has lots of <a href="https://www.overleaf.com/learn" target="_blank"
        aria-label="Overleaf documentation">documentation</a>. Overleaf works similar to Google Docs
      in that all members can edit the file in parallel and changes are updated in real time.
      There is a way to directly invite group members to your document, but the free
      version of Overleaf only allows two people to work at the same time.
      To get around this, turn on link sharing: Click on “Share” in the top right,
      Click “Turn on link sharing”, Copy the displayed link and share it with your group members.
      To export your work, click on the “Download PDF” button on the right-hand side
      If you want to export the raw source files, click on the “Menu” button in the top-left, then click on “Source”

    <p>This <a href="http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/LaTeX" target="_blank">open source LaTeX reference</a>
      can be helpful when getting started,
      and you can use the .tex source of all the files we use in class as templates.</p>

    <p>Alternatively, you can use Google Docs, which is available through your @ucsd.edu account.
      You can create documents and then share them with your group members with manual invites
      or a shareable link. Google Docs has a LaTex add-on that lets you type formulas in
      a math typesetting environment: search for "Auto-LaTeX Equations" if you want to try this option.
      You'll need to use the display environment (start and end with $) for all the
      portions you want rendered with LaTeX.
    </p>

    <h2 style="line-height: 20px;"><br><br>Grading and academic integrity<br><br><br></h2>

    <p>Grades in this class are designed to reflect your work and to document evidence of your learning this core
      material. They are also designed to accommodate the ongoing impacts of the
      pandemic and to allow flexibility in the face of uncertain public health situations.
      By working together to explore the CSE 20 material with integrity, we can each help ensure a <b>fair</b> and
      <b>interesting</b>
      quarter of building the foundations needed for your continued development in Computer Science.
      Please reach out to me (minnes@eng.ucsd.edu) if you have extenuating circumstances that you think will impede your
      ability to participate in the planned CSE 20 activities; I'd like to work out a solution together.
    </p>

    <p>
      The graded components for CSE 20 will be Review quizzes, Homework, Project, and Final exam.
      Your overall grade for CSE 20 will be computed using the weights
    <ul style="margin-left: 4%; font-size:150%;">
      <li><a href="http://www.gradescope.com" aria-label="Go to Gradescope"><b>Review quizzes</b></a>: 
        25% of overall score. You will need to achieve a passing grade
        (70%) with integrity on the
        review quiz component of this class to pass this course.<br><br>

        <em>Why?</em> To help you
        track and confirm your understanding of the concepts and examples we work in class
        and give you immediate feedback.</em><br>
        <em>How?</em> Quizzes can be submitted as many times (with no penalty) as you like
        until the quiz deadline:
        the three quizzes each week are all due on Friday (with late submission open until Sunday; 
        no penalty for late submission of quizzes).
        The lowest three quiz scores will not be
        included in your overall review quiz average. You can collaborate with other CSE 20
        students on review quizzes and you can ask questions about them in public
        posts on Piazza and in drop-in help hours.<br><br>

        <em>Why?</em> To give you practice with the main concepts and techniques of the course, while getting to
        know and learn from your classmates.<br>
        <em>How?</em> Weekly homework may be done individually or in groups of up to 3 students.
        You may switch HW partners for different HW assignments.
        The lowest HW score will not be included in your
        overall HW average. Please ensure your name(s) and PID(s)
        are clearly visible on the first page of your homework
        submission and then upload the PDF to
        <a href="http://gradescope.com" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to Gradescope">Gradescope</a>.
        If working in a group, <b>submit only one submission per group</b>: one partner uploads the
        submission through their Gradescope account and then adds the other group member(s) to the Gradescope submission
        by selecting their name(s) in the "Add Group Members" dialog box. You will need to re-add your group member(s)
        every time you resubmit a new version of your assignment. Each homework question will be graded either for
        <b>correctness</b> (including clear and precise explanations and justifications of all answers) or
        <b>fair effort completeness</b>. You may only collaborate on HW with CSE 20 students in your group; if your
        group has questions about a HW problem, you may ask in drop-in help hours or post a private
        post (visible only to the Instructors) on Piazza.<br><br>

      <li><a href="assignments.html" aria-label="Go to assignments page"><b>Project</b></a>: 30% of overall score. You will need to achieve a passing grade
        (70%) with integrity on the project
        component of this class to pass this course.<br><br>

        <em>Why?</em> To go deeper and extend your work on assignments and to explore an application of your
        choosing.<br>

        <em>How?</em> During emergency remote instruction last academic year, we discovered
        that video assessement and some open-ended personalized projects help ensure fairness
        and can be less stressful for students than in-person midterm exams. Asynchronous project
        submission also gives flexibility and allows more physical distancing.<br><br>
      </li>
      <li><a href="overview_calendar.html" aria-label="Go to class calendar"><b>Final</b></a>: 15% of overall score.</li>

      <em>Why?</em> To review the entire quarter and solidify your understanding of CSE 20's foundational
      material.</em><br>

      <em>How?</em> Cumulative test on class content during exam week.
      The exam must reflect your own independent effort. The exam may have a combination of True/False, multiple
      choice, select-all-that-apply, and free-response questions.</em>

    <p>The UC San Diego Academic Integrity pledge is
      <a href="https://academicintegrity.ucsd.edu/forms/form-pledge.html" target="_blank">here</a>.
      Academic integrity violations will be taken seriously and reported to the campus-wide Academic Integrity Office.
      Key facts about academic integrity related to CSE 20:
    <ul style="margin-left: 4%; font-size:150%;">
      <li>Use only resources explicitly allowed for each assignment. Resources not affiliated with this quarter's
        version of the class may use inconsistent notation or definitions. If you need help, please reach out to the
        instructor, TAs, and tutors.</li>
      <li>Do not share written solutions or partial solutions for homework with other students in the class who are not
        in your group. Doing so would dilute their learning experience and detract from their success in the class.</li>
      <li>Before and during taking any individual assessment, do not attempt to obtain information about the contents of
        the exam from students who have already taken it or from any nonauthorized source.</li>
      <li>You may not ask for help from anyone while taking individual assessments since they are intended to reflect
        <i>your own</i> mastery of the material. In particular, you may not collaborate on exam questions with other
        students in the class and you may not post any portion of the exam on forums where others may assist you.
      </li>
      <li>After taking an exam or quiz, do not discuss its contents with anyone in the class
        who has not yet taken it. Do not post information about it or share information about it with others who haven't
        taken it.</li>
    </ul>
    </p>

    <h2>Policies</h2>

    <h3>Regrades</h3>
    <p>Regrades need to be requested within three days of announcement of grades. The regrade window will
      be set in <a href="http://gradescope.com" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to Gradescope">Gradescope</a>.
      In the regrade request, include a brief but detailed explanation of why you
      think there was an error in the grading. A regrade request may lead to us reviewing the entire assignment and may
      lead to the score
      being adjusted up or down depending on any errors found in the original grading. All regrades will
      be considered once the regrade window closes; thank you in advance for your patience while we
      carefully look through them.</p>


    <h3>Accommodations for students with disabilities</h3>
    <p>We would like to work with each of you to make this course accessible
      and approachable. All course material is available in multiple formats
      to improve support for screen readers. Videos will also be captioned (to the
      best of our abilities). We need to hear from you if additional accommodations
      would improve your experience in the course.

      If you have documented need for accommodations because of a disability,
      please work with the Office for Students with Disabilities (OSD)
      to get a current Authorization for
      Accommodation (AFA) letter. The office is located in
      University Center 202 behind Center Hall and also provides
      the <a href="https://academicaffairs.ucsd.edu/sso/osdsp/home" target="_blank">OSD Student Portal</a>. We ask that
      you work
      to organize the AFA and to let us know about it as early in the quarter as possible
      so that we can best support your needs.
      For more information, see

      student who is enrolled in or auditing this course.
      You may not reproduce, distribute or display (post/upload) lecture notes or recordings or
      course materials in any other way — whether or not a fee is charged — without my express
      prior written consent. You also may not allow others to do so.

    <h3>Solicitation</h3>
    <p> Individuals are not permitted to approach students to offer services of any kind in exchange 
      for pay, including tutoring services. This is considered solicitation for business and is 
      strictly prohibited by University policy.</p>

    <h3>Educational Research</h3>

    <p>This class is participating in research to understand an array of specific classroom and learning experience that
      students have in response to the pedagogical and curricular decisions instructors make and to address the
      following research questions:</p>
    <ul style="margin-left: 4%; font-size:150%;">
      <li>What pedagogies lead to better learning outcomes, and for which students?</li>
      <li>What educational practices increase the persistence and success of students, particularly those from
        underrepresented groups?</li>
      <li>What student practices lead to increased learning and success in real-world settings?</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Answers to these questions will inform teaching practice at UC San Diego, and also have the potential to
      contribute
      to the global knowledge base of how to improve student learning in a large university setting.
      Specifically for this quarter, CSE 20 is participating in a project on
      retention and sense of community in UCSD majors; see
      <a href="../../files/CSInclusiveMentoringConsentFormNonCSEDataAnalysis.pdf" target="_blank">
        research plan</a>.
