{\bf Cantor-Schroder-Bernstein Theorem}: For all nonempty sets,
\[
|A| = |B| \qquad\text{if and only if} \qquad (|A| \leq |B| ~\text{and}~ |B| \leq |A|)
\qquad\text{if and only if} \qquad (|A| \geq |B| ~\text{and}~ |B| \geq |A|)
\]

To prove $|A| = |B|$,  we can do any {\bf one} of the following

\begin{itemize}\setlength{\itemsep}{-5pt}
\item Prove there exists  a bijection $f:  A \to B$;
\item Prove there exists a  bijection  $f: B  \to  A$;
\item Prove there exists two functions $f_1: A \to B$, $f_2: B \to  A$ where each of $f_1, f_2$ is one-to-one.
\item Prove there exists two functions $f_1: A \to B$, $f_2: B \to  A$ where each of $f_1, f_2$ is onto.
\end{itemize}
