For nonempty sets $A, B$ we say
\begin{align*}
|A| \leq |B| &\text{ means there is a one-to-one function with domain $A$, codomain $B$} \\
|A| \geq |B| &\text{ means there is an onto function with domain $A$, codomain $B$} \\
|A| = |B| &\text{ means there is a bijection with domain $A$, codomain $B$}
\end{align*}

For all sets $A$, we say $|A| = |\emptyset|$, $|\emptyset| = |A|$ if and only if $A = \emptyset$.
