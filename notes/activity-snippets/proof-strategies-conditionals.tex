{\bf New! Proof of conditional by direct proof}: To prove that the conditional statement $p \to q$ is true, 
we can assume $p$ is true and use that assumption to show $q$ is true.

{\bf New! Proof of conditional by contrapositive proof}: To prove that the implication $p \to q$ is true, 
we can assume $q$ is false and use that assumption to show $p$ is also false.

{\bf New! Proof of disjuction using equivalent conditional}: To prove that the 
disjunction $p \lor q$ is true, we can rewrite it equivalently as $\lnot p \to q$ and
then use direct proof or contrapositive proof.
