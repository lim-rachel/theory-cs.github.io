In the table  below,  each row represents a user's ratings of movies: 
\cmark~(check) indicates the person liked the movie, \xmark~(x)
that they didn't, and $\bullet$ (dot) that they didn't rate it one way or 
another (neutral rating or didn't watch). Can encode
these ratings numerically with $1$ for \cmark~(check), $-1$ for \xmark~(x), 
and $0$ for $\bullet$ (dot).
