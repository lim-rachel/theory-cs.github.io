{\bf Proof by Mathematical Induction}

To prove a universal quantification over the set of all integers greater than
or  equal to some  base integer $b$,

\vspace{-10pt}

\begin{itemize}
\item[] {\bf Basis Step}:  Show the property holds for $b$. 
\item[]  {\bf Recursive Step}:  Consider an arbitrary integer $n$ greater than or  equal to  $b$, assume
    (as the {\bf induction hypothesis})  that the property holds  for $n$, and use  this and
    other facts to  prove that  the property holds for $n+1$.
\end{itemize}
