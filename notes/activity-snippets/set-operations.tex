\fbox{\parbox{\textwidth}{%
To define a set we can use the roster method, set builder notation, a recursive definition, 
and also we can apply a set operation to other sets. \\

{\bf New! Cartesian product of sets} and {\bf set-wise concatenation of sets of strings}\\


{\bf Definition}: Let $X$ and $Y$ be sets.  The {\bf Cartesian product} of $X$ and $Y$, denoted
$X \times Y$, is the set of all ordered pairs $(x,y)$ where $x \in X$ and $y \in Y$
\[
X \times Y = \{ (x,y) \mid x \in X \text{ and } y \in Y \}
\]

Conventions: (1) Cartesian products can be chained together to result in sets of $n$-tuples and 
(2) When we form the Cartesian product of a set with itself $X \times X$ we can denote that set as 
$X^2$, or $X^n$ for the Cartesian product of a set with itself $n$ times for a positive integer $n$.\\

{\bf Definition}: Let $X$ and $Y$ be sets of strings over the same alphabet. The {\bf set-wise concatenation} 
of $X$ and $Y$, denoted $X \circ Y$, is the set of all results of string concatenation $xy$ where $x \in X$ 
and $y \in Y$
\[
X \circ Y = \{ xy \mid x \in X \text{ and } y \in Y \}
\]
}}

{\bf Pro-tip}: the meaning of writing one element next to another like $xy$ depends on the data-types of $x$ and 
$y$. When $x$ and $y$ are strings, the convention is that $xy$ is the result of string concatenation. 
When $x$ and $y$ are numbers, the convention is that $xy$ is the result of multiplication. This is 
(one of the many reasons) why is it very important to declare the data-type of variables before we use them.
