Real-life representations are often prone to corruptions.  Biological codes, like RNA, 
may mutate naturally\footnote{Mutations of specific RNA codons have been linked to many disorders and cancers.}
and during measurement; cosmic radiation and other ambient noise 
can flip bits in computer storage\footnote{This RadioLab podcast episode
goes into more detail on bit flips: \url{https://www.wnycstudios.org/story/bit-flip}}. 
One way to recover from corrupted data is to exploit redundancy.  
Consider the following algorithm to introduce redundancy in a string of $0$s and $1$s.
\begin{algorithm}[caption={Create redundancy by repeating each bit three times}]
procedure $\textit{redun3}$($a_{k-1} \cdots a_0$: a binary string)
for $i$ := $0$ to $k-1$
  $c_{3i}$ := $a_i$
  $c_{3i+1}$ := $a_i$
  $c_{3i+2}$ := $a_i$
return $c_{3k-1} \cdots c_0$
\end{algorithm}

\begin{algorithm}[caption={Decode sequence of bits using majority rule on consecutive three bit sequences}]
procedure $\textit{decode3}$($c_{3k-1} \cdots c_0$: a binary string whose length is an integer multiple of $3$)
for $i$ := $0$ to $k-1$
  if exactly two or three of $c_{3i}, c_{3i+1}, c_{3i+2}$ are set to $1$
    $a_i$ := 1
  else 
    $a_i$ := 0
return $a_{k-1} \cdots a_0$
\end{algorithm}

For each of the following, type in your answers precisely including all notational punctuation.

\begin{enumerate}
\item  Give the output of $redun3(100)$.
\item  If the output of running $redun3$ is $000000111000111$, what was its input?
\item  Give the output of $decode3(100)$.
\item  How many distinct possible inputs to $decode3$ give the output $01$?
\end{enumerate}
