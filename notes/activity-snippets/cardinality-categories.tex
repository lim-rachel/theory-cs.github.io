A set $A$ is {\bf finite} means it is empty or it is the same size as $\{ 1, \ldots, n \}$ for some $n \in \mathbb{N}$.

A set $A$ is {\bf countably infinite} means it is the same size as $\mathbb{N}$. {\it Notice: 
all countably infinite sets are the same size as each other.}

A set $A$ is {\bf countable} means it is either finite or countably infinite.

A set $A$ is {\bf uncountable} means it is not countable.
