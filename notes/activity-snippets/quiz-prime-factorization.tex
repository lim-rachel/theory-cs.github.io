Recall that a prime factorization is a product of primes (potentially with some of the primes
occurring more than once).
Select all and only the correct prime factorizations of positive integers.

\begin{enumerate}
    \item $2\cdot 2 \cdot 2 \cdot 2$
    \item $3$
    \item $3 \cdot 4 \cdot 5$
    \item $17 \cdot 21$
    \item $2 \cdot 11$
\end{enumerate}
