{\bf Claim} $\forall s \in S ~(~rnalen(s) > 0~)$

{\bf Proof}: Let $s$ be an arbitrary RNA strand. By the recursive definition of $S$,
either $s \in B$ or there is some strand $s_0$ and some base $b$ such that $s = s_0 b$.
We will show that the inequality holds for both cases.

{$\phantom{Basis}$} {\bf Case}: Assume $s \in B$. We need to show $rnalen(s) > 0$. 
By the basis step in the definition of $rnalen$,
$$rnalen(s) = 1$$
which is greater than $0$, as required.

{$\phantom{Recursive}$} {\bf Case}: Assume there is some strand $s_0$ and some base $b$ 
such that $s = s_0 b$. We will show {\it (the stronger claim)} that 
\[
    \forall u \in S ~\forall b \in B ~( ~\textit{rnalen}(u) >0  \to 
    \textit{rnalen}(ub) >0 ~)
\]
Consider an arbitrary RNA strand $u$ and an arbitrary base $b$, and assume towards a
direct proof,$~~{\phantom{ this is the induction hypothesis}}~~$ that
\[
    rnalen(u) > 0
\]
We need to show that $rnalen(ub) > 0$.
\[
    rnalen(ub) = 1 + rnalen (u) > 1 + 0 = 1 > 0
\]
as required.
