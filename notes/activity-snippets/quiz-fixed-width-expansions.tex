Recall the definitions from class for number representations for {\bf base $b$ expansion of $n$},
{\bf  base $b$ fixed-width $w$ expansion of $n$}, and {\bf base $b$ fixed-width expansion of $x$ 
with integer part width $w$ and fractional part width $w'$}.

For example, the base $2$ (binary) expansion of $4$ is 
$\qquad
(100)_2 \qquad$
and the base $2$ (binary) fixed-width $8$ expansion of $4$ is
$\qquad
(00000100)_{2,8} \qquad$
and the base $2$ (binary) fixed-width expansion of $4$ with integer part width $3$ and fractional
part width $2$ of $4$ is
$\qquad
(100.00)_{2,3,2} \qquad$

Compute the listed expansions.  Enter your number using the notation for base 
expansions with parentheses but without subscripts. For example, 
if your answer were $(100)_{2,3}$
you would type \texttt{(100)2,3} into Gradescope.

\begin{enumerate}
\item Give the binary (base $2$) expansion of the number whose octal (base $8$) expansion is
\[
(371)_8
\]
\item Give the decimal (base $10$) expansion of the number whose octal (base $8$) expansion is
\[
(371)_8
\]
\item Give the octal (base $8$) fixed-width $3$ expansion of $(9)_{10}$ .
\item Give the ternary (base $3$) fixed-width $8$ expansion of $(9)_{10}$ .
\item Give the hexadecimal (base $16$) fixed-width $6$ expansion of
$(16711935)_{10}$ .\footnote{This matches a frequent debugging task --
sometimes a program will show a number formatted as a base $10$
integer that is much better understood with another representation.}
\item Give the hexadecimal (base $16$) fixed-width $4$ expansion of
$$(1011~ 1010 ~ 1001~ 0000 )_2$$
Note: the spaces between each group of 4 bits above are for your convenience only.  How
might they help your calculations?
\item Give the binary fixed width expansion of $0.125$ with integer part width $2$ and 
fractional part width $4$.
\item Give the binary fixed width expansion of $1$ with integer part width $2$ and 
fractional part width $3$.
