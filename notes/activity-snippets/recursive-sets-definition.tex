{\bf New! Recursive Definitions of Sets}: The set $S$ (pick a name) is defined by:
\[
\begin{array}{ll}
\textrm{Basis Step: } & \textrm{Specify finitely many elements of } S\\
\textrm{Recursive Step: } & \textrm{Give rule(s) for creating a new element of } S \textrm{ from known values existing in } S, \\
& \textrm{and potentially other values}. \\
\end{array}
\]
The set $S$ then consists of all and only elements that are put in $S$ by finitely many (a nonnegative integer number) of
applications of the recursive step after the basis step.
