Recall the game Nim from class.

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Why did we use strong induction to prove that Player 2's strategy guarantees a win?
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Because there are two players in the game.
        \item Because each turn can involve a player taking some positive number 
        of jellybeans from a pile, not just one jellybean.
        \item Because the strategy player 2 uses depends on what player 1 does.
        \item Because the set of natural numbers is recursively defined.
    \end{enumerate}
    \item  If we modify the game so that in each turn, a player could take jellybeans
    from one or both piles, which player has a winning strategy?
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Player 1.
        \item Player 2.
        \item Neither in general, the existence of a winning strategy for the players depends 
        on how many jellybeans are in each pile to start.
    \end{enumerate}
    \item  If we modify the game so that in each turn, a player must take 
    exactly one jellybean, which player has a winning strategy?
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Player 1.
        \item Player 2.
        \item Neither in general, the existence of a winning strategy for the players depends 
        on how many jellybeans are in each pile to start.
    \end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}
