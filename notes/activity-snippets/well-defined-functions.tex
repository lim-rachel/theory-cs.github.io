Recall that a function is defined by its (1) domain, (2) codomain, and (3) rule assigning each 
element in the domain exactly one element in the codomain. 
The domain and codomain are nonempty sets.
The rule can be depicted as a table, formula, English description, etc.

A function can {\it fail to be well-defined} if there is some 
domain element where the function rule doesn't give a
unique codomain element. For example, the function rule might lead to 
more than one potential image, or to an image outside of the codomain.


{\it Example}: $f_A: \mathbb{R}^+ \to \mathbb{Q}$ with $f_A(x) = x$ is {\bf not} a well-defined function because

{\it Example}: $f_B: \mathbb{Q} \to \mathbb{Z}$ with $f_B\left(\frac{p}{q}\right) = p+q$ is {\bf not} a well-defined function because

{\it Example}: $f_C: \mathbb{Z} \to \mathbb{R}$ with $f_C(x) = \frac{x}{|x|}$ is {\bf not} a well-defined function because
