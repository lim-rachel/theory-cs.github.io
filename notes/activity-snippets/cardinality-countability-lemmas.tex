{\bf Lemmas about countable and uncountable sets}

{\bf Lemma}: If $A$ is a subset of a countable set, then it's countable.

{\bf Lemma}: If $A$ is a superset of an uncountable set, then it's uncountable.

{\bf Lemma}: If $A$ and $B$ are countable sets, then $A \cup B$ is countable
and $A \cap B$ is countable.

{\bf Lemma}: If $A$ and $B$ are countable sets, then $A \times B$ is countable.

{\bf Lemma}: If $A$ is a subset of $B$ , to show that $|A| = |B|$, 
it's enough to give one-to-one function from $B$ to $A$ or an onto function 
from $A$ to $B$.
