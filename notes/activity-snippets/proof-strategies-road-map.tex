We now have propositional and predicate logic that can help us express 
statements about any domain. We will develop proof strategies to 
craft valid argument for proving that such statements are true or disproving
them (by showing they are false). We will practice these strategies with 
statements about sets and numbers, both because they are familiar and because they
can be used to build cryptographic systems. Then we will apply proof strategies
more broadly to prove statements about data structures and machine learning 
applications.
