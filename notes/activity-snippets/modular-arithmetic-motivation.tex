Integers are useful because they can be used to encode other objects
and have multiple representations. However, infinite sets are sometimes
expensive to work with computationally. Reducing our attention to 
a {\it partition of the integers} based on congrunce mod $n$, where
each part is represented by a (not too large) integer gives a useful 
compromise where many algebraic properties of the integers are preserved, 
and we also get the benefits of a finite domain. Moreover, modular arithmetic
is well-suited to model any cyclic behavior.
