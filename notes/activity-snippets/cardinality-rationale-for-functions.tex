{\bf Key idea for cardinality}: Counting 
distinct elements is a way of labelling elements
with natural numbers. This is a function!
In general, functions let us 
associate elements of one set with those
of another. If the association is ``{\it good}", 
we get a correspondence between the elements of the subsets
which can relate the sizes of the sets.
