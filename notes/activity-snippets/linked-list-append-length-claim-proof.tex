{\bf Claim}: $\forall l \in L ~ (~length(~append(~(l, 100)~)~) > length(l)~)$

{\bf Proof:} By structural induction on $L$, we have two cases:

{\bf Basis Step}

    \begin{tabular}{l p{3.5in}}
     1. \textbf{To Show} $length(~append(~([], 100)~)~) > length(~[]~)$
    & Because $[]$ is the only element defined in the basis step of $L$, 
    we only need to prove that the property holds for $[]$.\\
    &  \\
     2. \textbf{To Show} $length(~(100,[])~) > length(~[]~)$
    &  By basis step in definition of $append$.\\
    &  \\
     3. \textbf{To Show} $(1 +length(~[]~)) > length(~[]~)$
    &  By recursive step in definition of $length$.\\
    &  \\    
     4. \textbf{To Show} $1+0 > 0$
    &  By basis step in definition of $length$.\\
    &  \\    
    5. $T$
    & By properties of integers \\
    &  \\    
    QED & Because we got to $T$ only by rewriting \textbf{To Show} to equivalent statements, using well-defined proof techniques, and applying definitions. \\
    \end{tabular}

{\bf Recursive Step}

Consider an arbitrary: $l' \in L$, $n \in \mathbb{N}$, and we  assume
as the {\bf induction hypothesis} that:
\[
length(~append(~(l', 100~)~)~) > length(l')
\]
Our goal is to show that $length(~append( ~(~(n,l'), 100~)~)~) > length(~(n,l')~)$ is also true. 
We start by working with
one side of the candidate inequality:
\begin{align*}
LHS &= length(~append( ~(~ (n,l'), 100~)~)~) \\
&= length(~(n, append(~(l', 100)~)~ )~) \qquad \text{by the recursive definition of $append$}\\
&= 1 + length(~ append(~(l', 100)~) ~) \qquad \text{by the recursive definition of $length$}\\
&> 1+ length(l')  \qquad \text{by the induction hypothesis}\\
&= length( (n,l') )  \qquad \text{by the recursive definition of $length$}\\
&= RHS 
\end{align*}
