\item Consider the partial order on the set $\mathcal{P}(\{1,2,3\})$ given by the binary relation 
    $\{ (X,Y) ~|~X \subseteq Y \}$
    \begin{enumerate}
    \item How many nodes are in the Hasse diagram of this partial order?
    \item How many edges are in the Hasse diagram of this partial order?
    \end{enumerate}
\item Consider the binary relation on $\{1,2,4,5,10,20\}$ 
defined by $\{(a,b) ~|~ \exists c \in \mathbb{Z} ( b = ac)\}$.
