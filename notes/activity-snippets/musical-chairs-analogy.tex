{\it Analogy}: Musical chairs

\begin{multicols}{2}
\includegraphics[width=1.8in]{../../resources/images/musicalchairs.png}
\columnbreak

People try to sit down when the music stops

Person\sun~ sits in Chair 1,
Person\smiley~ sits in Chair 2,

Person\frownie~  is left standing!
\end{multicols}
What does this say about the number of chairs and the number of people?
