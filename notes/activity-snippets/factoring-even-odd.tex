{\bf Definition}: an integer $n$ is {\bf even} means that there is an integer $a$ such that $n = 2a$; 
an integer $n$ is {\bf odd} means that there is an integer $a$ such that $n = 2a+1$.  Equivalently, 
an integer $n$ is {\bf even} means $n ~\textbf{ mod }~2 = 0$; an integer $n$ is {\bf odd} means $n ~\textbf{ mod }~2 = 1$.  
Also, an integer is even if and only if it is not odd.
