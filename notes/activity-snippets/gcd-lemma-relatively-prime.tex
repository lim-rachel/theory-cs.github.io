{\bf Lemma}: For any integers $p, q$ (not both zero), 
$gcd \left(~ \left(~\frac{p}{gcd(~(p,q)~)}, \frac{q}{gcd(~(p,q)~)} ~\right) ~\right) = 1$ .
In other words, can reduce to relatively prime integers by dividing by gcd.

{\bf Proof}:

Let $x$ be arbitrary positive integer and assume that $x$ is a 
factor of each of $\frac{p}{gcd(~(p,q)~)}$ and $\frac{q}{gcd(~(p,q)~)}$. 
This gives integers $\alpha$, $\beta$ such that 
\[
    \alpha x = \frac{p}{gcd(~(p,q)~)} \qquad \qquad \beta x = \frac{q}{gcd(~(p,q)~)}
\]
Multiplying both sides by the denominator in the RHS: 
\[
    \alpha x \cdot gcd(~(p,q)~)= p \qquad \qquad \beta x \cdot gcd(~(p,q)~)= q
\]
In other words, $x \cdot gcd(~(p,q)~)$ is a common divisor of $p, q$. By definition of $gcd$, this means
\[
    x \cdot gcd (~(p,q)~) \leq gcd (~(p,q)~)
\]
and since $gcd(~(p,q)~)$ is positive, this means, $x \leq 1$.
