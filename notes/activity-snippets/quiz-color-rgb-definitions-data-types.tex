In the definition of colors as amounts of red, green, and blue mixed together, why are $3$-tuples a convenient data structure to use rather than sets or strings?

(Select all and only relevant choices)

\begin{enumerate}
\item Ordering matters in $n$-tuples, so we can use the different components of the $3$-tuple to represent the amounts of specific colors. 
\item There are many possible values for each color amount and we don't have individual characters for each value so a string could get unwieldy.
\item It's possible to have the same value of two or all of the colors, and repetition matters in $n$-tuples.
\end{enumerate}
