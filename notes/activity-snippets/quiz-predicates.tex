Consider the following predicates, each of which has 
as its domain the set of all bitstrings whose leftmost bit is $1$

$E(x)$ is $T$ exactly when $(x)_{2}$ is even, and is $F$ otherwise

$L(x)$ is $T$ exactly when $(x)_2 < 3$, and is $F$ otherwise

$M(x)$ is $T$ exactly when $(x)_2 > 256$ and is $F$ otherwise.

\begin{enumerate}
\item What is $E(110)$?
\item Why is $L(00)$ undefined?
\begin{enumerate}
\item Because the domain of $L$ is infinite
\item Because $00$ does not have $1$ in the leftmost position
\item Because $00$ has length 2, not length 3
\item Because $(00)_{2,2} = 0$ which is less than $3$
\end{enumerate}
\item Is there a bitstring of width (where width is the number of bits) $6$ at which $M(x)$ evaluates 
to $T$?
\end{enumerate}
