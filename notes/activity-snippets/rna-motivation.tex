RNA is made up of strands of four different bases that encode genomic information
in specific ways.\\
The bases are elements of the set 
$B  = \{\A, \C, \U, \G \}$.
Strands are ordered nonempty finite sequences of bases.

Formally, to define the set of all RNA strands, we need more than roster
method or set builder descriptions.
