When a predicate $P(x)$ is over a {\bf finite} domain:
\begin{itemize}
\item To show that $\forall x  P(x)$ is true: check that $P(x)$ evaluates to $T$ at each domain element by evaluating over and over.
\item To show that $\forall x  P(x)$ is false: find one counterexample, a domain element where $P(x)$ evaluates to $F$.
\item To show that $\exists x  P(x)$ is true: find one witness, a domain element where $P(x)$ evaluates to $T$.
\item To show that $\exists x  P(x)$ is false: check that $P(x)$ evaluates to $F$ at each domain element by evaluating over and over.
\end{itemize}
