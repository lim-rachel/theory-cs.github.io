\begin{itemize}
    \item The power set of any countably infinite set is uncountable. For example:
    \[
        \mathcal{P}(\mathbb{N}), \mathcal{P}(\mathbb{Z^+}), \mathcal{P}(\mathbb{Z})
    \]
    are each uncountable.
    \item The closed interval $\{x \in \mathbb{R} ~|~ 0 \leq x \leq 1\}$, any other nonempty closed interval of real numbers whose endpoints are 
    unequal, as well as the related intervals that exclude one or both of the endpoints.
    \item The set of all real numbers $\mathbb{R}$ is uncountable and the set of irrational
    real numbers $\overline{\mathbb{Q}}$ is uncountable.
