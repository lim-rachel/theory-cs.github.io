Select all and only the true statements below about the relationship between
structural induction and mathematical induction.
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Both structural induction and mathematical induction are proof strategies that 
    may be useful when proving universal claims about recursively defined sets.
    \item Mathematical induction is a special case of structural induction, for the case when 
    the domain of quantification is $\{ n \in \mathbb{Z} \mid n \geq b\}$ for some integer $b$.
    \item Universal claims about the set of all integers may be proved using structural induction
    but not using mathematical induction.
\end{enumerate}
