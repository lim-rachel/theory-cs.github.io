{\bf Proof by Structural Induction} 
To prove a universal quantification over a recursively defined set:
\begin{itemize}
    \item[] {\bf Basis Step}:  Show the statement holds for elements specified in the basis step of the definition.
    \item[]  {\bf Recursive Step}:  Show that if the statement is true for each of the elements used to construct
    new elements in the recursive step of the definition, the result holds for these new elements.
    \end{itemize}
