For which nonnegative integers  $n$ can we make change for $n$ with coins of 
value $5$ cents and $3$ cents?


Restating: We can make change for \underline{\phantom{$3$~~,~~ $5$~~,~~ $6$}}, we
cannot make change for \underline{\phantom{$1$~~,~~ $2$~~,~~ $4$~~,~~ $7$}}, and 
\[
\underline{\phantom{\forall n  \in  \mathbb{Z}^{\geq 8}  \exists x \in \mathbb{N}  \exists y \in \mathbb{N}  (  5x+3y =  n)\qquad \qquad}} \star
\]
