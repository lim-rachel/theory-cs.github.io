{\bf Claim}: For each  $a \in U$, $[a]_{E}  \neq  \emptyset$.

{\bf Proof}: Towards a $\underline{\phantom{\hspace{1.3in}}}$ 
consider an arbitrary element $a$ in $U$. 
We will work to show that $[a]_E \neq \emptyset$, namely that $\exists x \in [a]_E$.
By definition of equivalence classes, we can rewrite this goal as 
$$\exists x \in U ~( ~(a,x) \in E~)$$ 
Towards a $\underline{\phantom{\hspace{1.3in}}}$, consider $x = a$, 
an element of $U$ by definition. By $\underline{\phantom{\hspace{1.3in}}}$ of $E$, 
we know that $(a,a) \in E$  and thus the existential quantification has been proved.\\


{\bf Claim}: For each $a \in U$, there is some $b \in U$  such that $a \in [b]_{E}$.

Towards a $\underline{\phantom{\hspace{1.3in}}}$ 
consider an arbitrary element $a$ in $U$. By definition of equivalence classes, 
we can rewrite the goal as 
$$\exists b \in U ~( ~(b,a) \in E~)$$
Towards a $\underline{\phantom{\hspace{1.3in}}}$, consider $b = a$, 
an element of $U$ by definition. By $\underline{\phantom{\hspace{1.3in}}}$  of $E$, 
we know that $(a,a) \in E$  and thus the existential quantification has been proved. \\
 
{\bf Claim}: For each  $a,b  \in U$ , $(~(a,b)  \in  E ~\to ~ [a]_{E}  = [b]_{E}~)$
and  $(~(a,b)  \notin  E ~\to ~ [a]_{E} \cap[b]_{E} = \emptyset~)$

\phantom{Let $a,b$ be arbitrary. For first goal, assume towards
direct proof that $(a,b) \in E$. To show $[a]_E = [b]_E$ 
first consider arbitrary element $x$ in $[a]_E$. By definition
$(a,x) \in E$ so by symmetry, $(x,a) \in E$ and by 
transitivity with assumption, $(x,b)\in E$. Thus, by definition
of equivalence class, $x \in [b]_E$. Similarly, take arbitrary
element $y \in [b]_E$. By definition $(y,b) \in E$ 
and applying symmetry to assumption, we have $(b,a) \in E$
so by transitivity $(y,a) \in E$ and $y \in[a]_E$, as required
to complete the proof of set equality. For the second goal, 
assume (towards a proof by contrapositive) that $[a]_E \cap [b]_E 
\neq \emptyset$. Then there is a witness $w \in [a]_E \cap [b]_E$.
By definition of equivalence classes $(a,w) \in E$ and $(b,w) \in E$.
By symmetry, we have $(w,b) \in E$ so by transitivity $(a,b) \in E$,
as required.}

{\bf Corollary}: Given an equivalence relation $E$ on set $U$,  
$\{ [x]_{E} \mid x \in U  \}$ is a partition of $U$.
