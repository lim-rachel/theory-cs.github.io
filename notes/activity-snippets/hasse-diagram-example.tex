Draw the Hasse diagram of the partial order on the set $\{a,b,c,d,e,f,g\}$ defined as
\begin{align*}
    \{  &(a,a), (b,b), (c,c), (d,d), (e,e), (f,f), (g,g), \\
        &(a,c), (a,d), (d,g), (a,g), (b,f), (b,e), (e,g), (b,g) \}
\end{align*}

\vspace{100pt}

% Notice that $a$ and $b$ are minimal elements in this partial order and $c$, $g$, and $f$
% are maximal elements in this partial order.
