\fbox{\parbox{\linewidth}{{\bf New! Proof by Cases}: To prove $q$, we can 
work by cases by first describing all possible cases we might be in
and then showing that each one guarantees $q$.
Formally, if we know that $p_1 \lor p_2$ is true, 
and we can show that $(p_1 \to q)$ is true and we can show that $(p_2 \to q)$, 
then we can conclude $q$ is true.
