{\bf Definitions}:

A {\bf set} is an  unordered collection of  elements.
When $A$ and  $B$ are sets,  $A = B$ (set equality) means  
\[
    \forall x  ( x\in A \leftrightarrow x \in B)
\]

When $A$ and  $B$ are sets, $A \subseteq B$ (``$A$ is a {\bf subset} of $B$") means 
\[
    \forall x  (x \in A  \to x  \in B)
\]

When $A$ and  $B$ are sets,  $A \subsetneq B$ (``$A$ is a {\bf proper subset} of $B$") means 
\[
    (A\subseteq B) \wedge  (A \neq B)
\]
