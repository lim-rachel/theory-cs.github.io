{\bf Definition}: When $a$ and $b$ are integers and $a$ is nonzero, 
{\bf $a$ divides $b$} means there is an integer $c$ such that $b = ac$ . 


Symbolically, $F(~(a,b)~) = \phantom{\exists c\in \mathbb{Z}~(b=ac)}$
and is  a predicate over the domain \underline{\phantom{$\mathbb{Z}^{\neq 0} \times \mathbb{Z}$}}


Other (synonymous) ways to say that $F(~(a,b)~)$ is true: 
\begin{center}
$a$ is a {\bf factor} of $b$
\qquad 
$a$ is a {\bf divisor} of $b$
\qquad  $b$ is a {\bf multiple} of $a$
\qquad
$a | b$
\end{center}

When $a$ is a positive integer and $b$ is any integer, $a | b$
exactly when $b \textbf{ mod } a = 0$

When $a$ is a positive integer and $b$ is any integer, $a | b$
exactly $b = a \cdot (b \textbf{ div } a)$
