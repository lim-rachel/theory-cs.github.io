{\bf New! Proof by universal generalization}: To prove that $\forall x \, P(x)$
is true, we can take an arbitrary element $e$ from the domain of 
quantification and show that $P(e)$ is true, without making any assumptions about $e$ 
other than that it comes from the domain.


An {\bf arbitrary} element of a set or domain is a fixed but unknown element from that set.
