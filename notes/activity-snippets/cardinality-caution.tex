{\it Caution}: we use 
familiar symbols to define cardinality, like
$| \phantom{\cdots} | \leq | \phantom{\cdots} |$
and 
$| \phantom{\cdots} | \geq | \phantom{\cdots} |$
and 
$| \phantom{\cdots} | = | \phantom{\cdots} |$, 
but the meaning of these symbols depends on context.
We've seen that vertical lines can mean absolute
value (for real numbers), divisibility (for integers), 
and now sizes (for sets). 

Now we see that $\leq$ and $\geq$ can mean comparing
numbers or comparing sizes of sets. When the sets being 
compared are finite, the definitions 
of $|A| \leq |B|$ agree. 

But, properties of numbers cannot be assumed when comparing
cardinalities of infinite sets.

In a nutshell: cardinality of sets is defined via functions.
This definition agrees with the usual notion of ``size'' for 
finite sets.
