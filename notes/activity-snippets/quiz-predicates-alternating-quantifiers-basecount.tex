Recall the predicate $BC$ with domain $S \times B \times \mathbb{N}$ from class,
$BC(~(s,b,n)~)$ means $basecount(~(s,b)~) = n$.
Match each sentence to its English translation, or select none of the above.
\begin{enumerate}
\item $\forall s \in S ~\exists n \in \mathbb{N} ~\forall b \in B ~basecount(~(s,b)~) = n$
\item $\forall s \in S ~\forall b \in B ~\exists n \in \mathbb{N} ~basecount(~(s,b)~) = n$
\item $\forall s \in S ~\forall n \in \mathbb{N} ~\exists b \in B ~basecount(~(s,b)~) = n$
\item $\forall b \in B ~\forall n \in \mathbb{N} ~\exists s \in S ~basecount(~(s,b)~) = n$
\item $\forall n \in \mathbb{N} ~\forall b \in B ~\exists s \in S ~basecount(~(s,b)~) = n$
\end{enumerate}

\begin{enumerate}[label=\roman*.]
    \item For each RNA strand and each possible base, the number of that base in that strand is a nonnegative integer.
    \item For each RNA strand and each nonnegative integer, there is a base that occurs this many times in this strand.
    \item Every RNA strand has the same number of each base, and that number is a nonnegative integer.
    \item For every given nonnegative integer, there is a strand where each possible base appears the given number of times.
    \item For every given base and nonnegative integer, there is an RNA strand that has this base occurring this many times.
\end{enumerate}


{\it Challenge}: Express symbolically

\begin{quote}
    There are (at least) two different RNA strands that have the same number of $\A$s.
