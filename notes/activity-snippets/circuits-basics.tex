In a {\bf combinatorial circuit} (also known as
a {\bf logic circuit}), we have {\bf logic gates} 
connected
by {\bf wires}. The inputs to the circuits are the 
values set on the input wires: possible
values are 0 (low) or 1 (high). The values
flow along the wires from left to right.
A wire may be split into two or more wires, 
indicated with a filled-in circle (representing
solder). Values stay the same along a wire. When 
one or more wires flow into a gate, the output 
value of that gate is computed
from the input values based on the gate's definition
table. Outputs of gates may become inputs to other
gates.
