{\bf Common ways to express logical operators in English}:

{\bf Negation} $\lnot p$ can be said in English as 

\vspace{-20pt}
\begin{itemize}
\item Not $p$.
\item It's not the case that $p$.
\item $p$ is false.
\end{itemize}

{\bf Conjunction} $p \land q$ can be said in English as

\vspace{-20pt}
\begin{itemize}
    \item $p$ and $q$.
    \item Both $p$ and $q$ are true.
    \item $p$ but $q$.
\end{itemize}

{\bf Exclusive or} $p \oplus q$ can be said in English as

\vspace{-20pt}
\begin{itemize}
    \item $p$ or $q$, but not both.
    \item Exactly one of $p$ and $q$ is true.
\end{itemize}

{\bf Disjunction} $p \lor q$ can be said in English as

\vspace{-20pt}
\begin{itemize}
    \item $p$ or $q$, or both.
    \item $p$ or $q$ (inclusive).
    \item At least one of $p$ and $q$ is true.
\end{itemize}

{\bf Conditional} $p \to q$ can be said in English as

\begin{multicols}{2}
\begin{itemize}
    \item if $p$, then $q$.
    \item $p$ is sufficient for $q$.
    \item $q$ when $p$.
    \item $q$ whenever $p$.
    \item $p$ implies $q$.
    \item $q$ follows from $p$.
    \item $p$ is sufficient for $q$.
    \item $q$ is necessary for $p$.
    \item $p$ only if $q$.
\end{itemize}
\end{multicols}

{\bf Biconditional}

\vspace{-20pt}
\begin{itemize}
    \item $p$ if and only if $q$.
    \item $p$ iff $q$.
    \item If $p$ then $q$, and conversely.
    \item $p$ is necessary and sufficient for $q$.
\end{itemize}
