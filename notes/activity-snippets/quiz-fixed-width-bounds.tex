Recall the definitions of signed integer representations from class: 
sign-magnitude and 2s complement.

\begin{enumerate}
   \item What is the least integer that can be represented in sign-magnitude 
   width $4$?
   \item What is the greatest integer that  can be represented in sign-magnitude 
   width $4$?
   \item What is the least integer that can be represented in 2s complement
   width $4$?
   \item What is the greatest integer that  can be represented in 2s complement
   width $4$?
\end{enumerate}
