{\it Extra examples}: Use the definition to prove that $1$ is not prime, $2$ is prime, $3$
is prime, $4$ is not prime, $5$ is prime, $6$ is not prime, and $7$ is prime.


{\bf True or False}: The statement ``There are three consecutive positive integers that are prime."

{\it Hint}: These numbers would be of the form $p, p+1, p+2$ (where $p$ is a positive integer).

{\bf Proof}: We need to show \underline{\phantom{$\exists p \in \mathbb{Z}^+ ~(~Pr(p) \land Pr(p+1) \land Pr(p+2)~)$}}

{\bf True or False}: The statement ``There are three consecutive odd positive integers that are prime."

{\it Hint}: These numbers would be of the form $p, p+2, p+4$ (where $p$ is an odd positive integer).

{\bf Proof}: We need to show \underline{\phantom{$\exists p \in \mathbb{Z}^+ ~(~(p \textbf{ mod } 2 = 1 \land Pr(p) \land Pr(p+2) \land Pr(p+4)~)$}}
