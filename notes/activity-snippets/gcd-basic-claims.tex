{\bf Claim}: For any integers $a,b$ (not both zero), $gcd(~(a,b)~) \geq 1$.

{\bf Proof}: {\it Show that $1$ is a common factor of any two integers, so since the gcd 
is the greatest common factor it is greater than or equal to any common factor.}

{\bf Claim}: For any positive integers $a,b$, $gcd(~(a,b)~) \leq a$ and $gcd( ~(a,b)~) \leq b$.

{\bf Proof} {\it Using the definition of gcd and the fact that factors of a positive integer
are less than or equal to that integer.}

{\bf Claim}: For any positive integers $a,b$, if $a$ divides $b$ then $gcd(~(a,b)~) = a$.

{\bf Proof} {\it Using previous claim and definition of gcd.}

{\bf Claim}: For any positive integers $a,b,c$, if there is some integer $q$ such that $a = bq + c$,
\[
    gcd(~(a,b)~) = gcd (~(b,c)~)
\]
{\bf Proof} {\it Prove that any common divisor of $a,b$ divides $c$ and that any common 
divisor of $b,c$ divides $a$.}
