{\it To define sets:}

To define a set using {\bf roster method}, explicitly list its elements. That is,
start with $\{$ then list elements of 
the set separated by commas and close with $\}$.

\vfill

To define a set using {\bf set builder definition}, either form 
``The set of all $x$ from the universe $U$ such that $x$ is ..." by writing
\[\{x \in U \mid ...x... \}\]
or form ``the collection of all outputs of some operation when the input ranges over the universe $U$"
by writing
\[\{ ...x... \mid x\in U \}\]

\vfill

We use the symbol $\in$ as ``is an element of'' to indicate membership in a set.\\

\newpage 

{\bf Example sets}: For each of the following, identify whether it's defined using the roster method
or set builder notation and give an example element.

Can we infer the data type of the example element from the notation?

\begin{itemize}
    \item[]$\{ -1, 1\}$
    \vfill
    \item[]$\{0, 0 \}$
    \vfill
    \item[]$\{-1, 0, 1 \}$
    \vfill
    \item[]$\{(x,x,x) \mid x \in \{-1,0,1\} \}$
    \vfill
    \item[]$\{ \}$
    \vfill
    \item[]$\{ x \in \mathbb{Z} \mid x \geq 0 \}$
    \vfill
    \item[]$\{ x \in \mathbb{Z}  \mid x > 0 \}$
    \vfill
    \item[]$\{ \smile, \sun \}$
    \vfill
    \item[]$\{\A,\C,\U,\G\}$
    \vfill
    \item[]$\{\A\U\G, \U\A\G, \U\G\A, \U\A\A \}$
    \vfill
\end{itemize}
