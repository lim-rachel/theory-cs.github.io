Recall this circuit from class:

 \end{center}

 Which of the following is true about all possible 
 input values $x,y,z,w$? (Select all and only 
 choices that are true for all values.)
 \begin{enumerate}
    \item The output $out$ is set to $1$ exactly when $x$ is $0$,
    and it is set to $0$ otherwise.
    \item The output $out$ is set to $1$ exactly when  $(xyzw)_{2,4} < 8$,
    and it is set to $0$ otherwise.
    \item The output $out$ is set to $1$ exactly when  $(wzyx)_{2,4}$
    is an even integer,
    and it is set to $0$ otherwise.
 \end{enumerate}
