Colors can be described as amounts of red, green, and blue mixed together
\footnote{This RGB representation is common in web applications.  Many online tools are available to play around with mixing these colors,  e.g. \url{https://www.w3schools.com/colors/colors_rgb.asp}. }
Mathematically, a color can be represented as a $3$-tuple $(r, g, b)$ where $r$ represents the red component, $g$ the green component, $b$ the blue component and where each of $r$, $g$, $b$ must be a value from this collection of numbers:
