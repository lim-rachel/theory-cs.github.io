{\bf Proof by Strong Induction}

To prove that a universal quantification over the set of all integers greater than or equal to some  base integer $b$ holds,  pick a  fixed nonnegative integer  $j$ and then: \hfill 

\begin{tabularx}{\textwidth}{lX}
    {\bf Basis Step}: & Show the statement holds for $b$, $b+1$, \ldots, $b+j$. \\
    {\bf Recursive Step}: & Consider an arbitrary integer $n$ greater than or  equal to $b+j$, assume
    (as the {\bf strong  induction hypothesis})  that the property holds  for {\bf each of} $b$, $b+1$, \ldots, $n$, 	
    and use  this and
    other facts to  prove that  the property holds for $n+1$.
\end{tabularx}
