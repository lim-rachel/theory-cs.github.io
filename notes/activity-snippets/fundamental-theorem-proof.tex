{\bf Theorem}: Every positive integer {\it greater than 1} is a product of (one or more) primes.

{\bf Before we prove, let's try some examples}:

$20 = $

$100 = $

$5 = $


{\bf Proof by strong induction}, with $b=2$ and $j=0$.

{\bf Basis step}:  WTS property is true about  $2$.

Since $2$ is itself prime,
it is already written as a product of (one) prime.


{\bf Recursive step}: Consider an arbitrary integer $n \geq 2$.
Assume (as the strong induction hypothesis, IH) that the property is true about  each of $2, \ldots, n$.  
WTS that the property is true about  $n+1$: We want to show that $n+1$ can be written 
as a product of primes.  Notice that $n+1$ is itself prime or it is composite.

{\it Case 1}: assume $n+1$ is prime and then immediately it is written as a product
of (one) prime so we are done.  

{\it Case 2}: assume that $n+1$ is composite
so there are integers $x$ and $y$ where $n+1 = xy$ and each of them is between $2$ and $n$
(inclusive).  Therefore, the induction hypothesis applies to each of $x$ and $y$ so each 
of these factors of $n+1$ can be written as a product of primes.  Multiplying these products together, 
we get a product of primes that gives $n+1$, as required. 

Since both cases give the necessary
conclusion, the proof by cases for the recursive step is complete.
