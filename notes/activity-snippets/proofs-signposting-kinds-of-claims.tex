To organize our proofs, it's useful to highlight which claims are most important for 
our overall goals.
We use some terminology to describe different roles statements can have.

{\bf Theorem}: Statement that can be shown to be true, usually an important one.

Less important theorems can be called {\bf proposition}, {\bf fact}, {\bf result}, {\bf claim}.

{\bf Lemma}: A less important theorem that is useful in proving a theorem.
 
{\bf Corollary}: A theorem that can be proved directly after another one has been proved, 
without needing a lot of extra work.

{\bf Invariant}: A theorem that describes a property that is true about an algorithm or 
system no matter what inputs are used.
