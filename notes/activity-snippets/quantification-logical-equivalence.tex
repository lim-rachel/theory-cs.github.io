Statements involving predicates and quantifiers are {\bf logically equivalent} 
means they have the same truth value no matter which predicates (domains and functions) 
are substituted in. 

{\bf Quantifier version of De Morgan's laws}: 
$\boxed{\neg \forall x P(x) ~\equiv~ \exists x \left( \neg P(x) \right)}$
\qquad
\qquad
$\boxed{\neg \exists x Q(x) ~\equiv~ \forall x \left( \neg Q(x) \right)}$
