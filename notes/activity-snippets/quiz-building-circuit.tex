In this question, we will consider how
to build a logic circuit with inputs $x_0$, $y_0$, $x_1$, $y_1$
and output $z$ such that $z = 1$ exactly when $(x_1x_0)_{2,2} < (y_1y_0)_{2,2}$ 
and $z = 0$ exactly when $(x_1x_0)_{2,2} \geq (y_1y_0)_{2,2}$.

\begin{enumerate}
    \item The first step towards designing this logic circuit is to construct its input-output table.
    How many rows does this table have (not including the header row labelling the columns)?
    \item What is the output for the row whose input values are $x_0 = 0$, $y_0 = 1$, $x_1 = 1$, $y_1 = 0$?
    \item What is the output for the row whose input values are $x_0 = 0$, $y_0 = 1$, $x_1 = 0$, $y_1 = 1$?
\end{enumerate}
