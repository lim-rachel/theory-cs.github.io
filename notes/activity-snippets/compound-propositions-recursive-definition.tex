%! outcome: evaluating compound propositions

We can use a recursive definition to describe all 
compound propositions that use propositional variables 
from a specified collection.  Here's the definition
for all compound propositions whose propositional variables 
are in $\{p, q\}$.

\[
\begin{array}{ll}
\textrm{Basis Step: } & p \textrm{ and } q \textrm{ are each a compound proposition} \\
\textrm{Recursive Step: } & \textrm{If } x \textrm{ is a compound proposition then so is } (\lnot x) 
\textrm{ and if } \\
& x \textrm{ and } y \textrm{ are both compound propositions then so is each of }\\
&(x \land y), (x \oplus y), (x \lor y), (x \to y), (x \leftrightarrow y)
\end{array}
\]
