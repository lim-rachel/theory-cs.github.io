For positive integer $n$, to represent $-n$ in 
$2$s complement with width $w$,
\begin{itemize}
    \item Calculate $2^{w-1} - n$, convert 
    result to binary fixed-width $w-1$, pad 
    with leading $1$, or
    \item Express $-n$ as a sum of powers of $2$, 
    where the leftmost $2^{w-1}$ is negative weight, or
    \item Convert $n$ to binary fixed-width $w$, 
    flip bits, add 1 (ignore overflow)
\end{itemize}

{\it Challenge: use definitions to explain why
each of these approaches works.}
