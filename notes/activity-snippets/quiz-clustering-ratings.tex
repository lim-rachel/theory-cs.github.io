Recall that 
in a movie recommendation system, each 
user's ratings of movies is represented as a $n$-tuple 
(with the positive integer $n$ 
being the number of movies in the database), 
and each component of 
the $n$-tuple is an element of the collection $\{-1,0,1\}$. 

We call $Rt_5$ the set of all ratings $5$-tuples.

Define $d: Rt_5 \times Rt_5 \to \mathbb{N}$ by
\[
    d (~(~ (x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4, x_5), (y_1, y_2, y_3, y_4, y_5) ~) ~) = \sum_{i=1}^5 |x_i - y_i|
\]

For a cluster of ratings $C = \{r_1, r_2, \cdots, r_n \} 
\subseteq U$, the {\bf diameter} of the cluster is defined by:

$$\textit{diameter}(C) = \max_{1 \leq i, j \leq n} (d(~(r_i, r_j)~))$$ 

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Calculate $diameter( \{ (-1,-1,-1,-1,1), (0,0,0,0,0), (1,1,1,1,1) \} )$
    \item What's the greatest (possible) diameter of a collection that has exactly two (distinct) ratings $5$-tuples?
    \item What's the least (possible) diameter of a collection that has exactly two (distinct) ratings $5$-tuples?
\end{enumerate}
