For a set of numbers $X$, how do you formalize ``there is a greatest $X$'' 
or ``there is a least $X$''?

\vspace{30pt}

{\bf Prove} or {\bf  disprove}:  There is a least prime number.

\vspace{100pt}

{\bf Prove} or {\bf  disprove}: There is a greatest integer. 

{\it Approach 1, De Morgan's and universal generalization}:

{\it Approach 2, proof by contradiction}:

{\it Extra examples}: 
Prove or disprove that $\mathbb{N}$,  $\mathbb{Q}$ each have a
least and a greatest element.
