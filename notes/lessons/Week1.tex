\subsection*{Spring quarter philosophy}
Spring 2022 is still a transition quarter so please be patient with us as we do our best 
to deliver a great learning opportunity that meets the needs of all students and adheres to the university guidelines. 

Please do not come to class if you are sick or even think you might be sick.

Please reach out (minnes@eng.ucsd.edu) if you need support with extenuating circumstances.

Based on current UCSD guidelines (as of March 21), masks are required in class. 
All students who attend class must also be fully vaccinated against COVID-19

\newpage Welcome to CSE 105: Introduction to Theory of Computation in Spring 2022!

\section*{CSE 105's Big Questions}
\begin{itemize}
   \item What problems are computers capable of solving?
   \item What resources are needed to solve a problem?
   \item Are some problems harder than others?
\end{itemize}

In this context, a {\bf problem} is defined as: ``Making a decision or computing a value based on some input"

Consider the following problems: 
\begin{itemize}
   \item Find a file on your computer
   \item Determine if your code will compile
   \item Find a run-time error in your code
   \item Certify that your system is un-hackable
\end{itemize}

Which of these is hardest?

\vfill

In Computer Science, we operationalize ``hardest'' as ``requires most resources'', where
resources might be memory, time, parallelism, randomness, power, etc.

To be able to compare ``hardness'' of problems, we use a consistent description of problems

{\bf Input}: String

{\bf Output}: Yes/ No, where Yes means that the input string matches the pattern or property described by the problem.
