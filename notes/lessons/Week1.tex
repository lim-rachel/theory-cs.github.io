\section*{Before we start}
If you or someone you know is suffering from food and/or housing insecurities 
there are UCSD resources here to help:

Basic Needs Office: \href{https://basicneeds.ucsd.edu/}{https://basicneeds.ucsd.edu/}

Triton Food Pantry (in the old Student Center)
is free and anonymous, and includes produce:

Mutual Aid UCSD: \href{https://mutualaiducsd.wordpress.com/}{https://mutualaiducsd.wordpress.com/}

If you find yourself in an uncomfortable situation, ask for help. 
We are committed to upholding University policies regarding nondiscrimination, sexual violence and sexual harassment.

\subsection*{Spring quarter philosophy}
Spring 2022 is a transition quarter so please be patient with us as we do our best 
to serve the needs of all students while adhering to the university guidelines. 
First and foremost is the health and safety of everyone.  
Please do not come to class if you are sick or even think you might be sick.
Please reach out (minnes@eng.ucsd.edu) if you need support with extenuating circumstances.

Masks are required in class. All students who attend class must also be fully vaccinated against COVID-19
unless they have a university-approved exemption.
Campus policy requires masks and daily ``symptom screeners" for everyone and we expect all students 
to follow these rules.

Welcome to CSE 105: Introduction to Theory of Computation in Spring 2022!

\section*{Themes and applications for CSE 105}
\begin{itemize}
\item {\bf Technical skepticism}: Know, select and apply appropriate computing knowledge and problem-solving techniques. 
Reason about computation and systems. 
Use mathematical techniques to solve problems. 
Determine appropriate conceptual tools to apply to new situations. 
Know when tools do not apply and try different approaches. 
Critically analyze and evaluate candidate solutions.
\item {\bf Multiple representations}: Understand, guide, shape impact of computing on society/the world. 
Connect the role of Theory CS classes to other applications (in undergraduate CS curriculum and beyond). 
Model problems using appropriate mathematical concepts.
Clearly and unambiguously communicate computational ideas using appropriate formalism. 
Translate across levels of abstraction.
\end{itemize}

{\bf Applications}: Numbers (how to represent them and use them in Computer Science), 
Recommendation systems and their roots in machine learning (with applications like Netflix),
``Under the hood" of computers (circuits, pixel color representation, data structures),
Codes and information (secret message sharing and error correction),
Bioinformatics algorithms and genomics (DNA and RNA).

\subsection*{Review: Week 1 Monday}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Please complete the beginning of the quarter survey \href{https://forms.gle/gvibFnNixxqcWbaU8}{https://forms.gle/gvibFnNixxqcWbaU8}
\item We want you to be familiar with class policies and procedures so you are ready to have a successful quarter. 
Please take a look at the class website http://cseweb.ucsd.edu/classes/fa21/cse20-a
and answer the questions about it on \href{http://gradescope.com}{Gradescope}.
