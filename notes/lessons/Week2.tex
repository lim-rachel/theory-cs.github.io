\subsection*{Week 2 at a glance}

\subsubsection*{We will be learning and practicing to:}
%data types, 
%div and mod
%trace algorithms
%translating
%write set definition
%function and relation definitions
%representing numbers
%applications of number representations
\begin{itemize}
\item Model systems with tools from discrete mathematics and reason about implications of modelling choices. Explore applications in CS through multiple perspectives, including software, hardware, and theory.
\begin{itemize}
   \item Selecting and representing appropriate data types and using notation conventions to clearly communicate choices
   \item Determining the properties of positional number representations, including overflow and bit operations
\end{itemize}

\item Translate between different representations to illustrate a concept.

\begin{itemize}
   \item Translating between symbolic and English versions of statements using precise mathematical language
   \item Tracing algorithms specified in pseudocode
   \item Representing numbers using positional representations, including decimal, binary, hexadecimal, fixed-width representations, and 2s complement
\end{itemize}


\item Use precise notation to encode meaning and present arguments concisely and clearly
\begin{itemize}
    \item Precisely describing a set using appropriate notation e.g. roster method, set builder notation, and recursive definitions
    \item Defining functions using multiple representations
\end{itemize}

\item Know, select and apply appropriate computing knowledge and problem-solving techniques. Reason about computation and systems. Use mathematical techniques to solve problems. Determine appropriate conceptual tools to apply to new situations. Know when tools do not apply and try different approaches. Critically analyze and evaluate candidate solutions.
\begin{itemize}
    \item Using a recursive definition to evaluate a function or determine membership in a set
    \item Using the definitions of the div and mod operators on integers
\end{itemize}

\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{TODO:}
\begin{list}
   {\itemsep2pt}
   \item \#FinAid Assignment on Canvas (complete as soon as possible) 
   \item Review quiz based on class material each day (due Friday April 12, 2024)
   \item Homework assignment 2 (due Tuesday April 16, 2024).
\end{list}
