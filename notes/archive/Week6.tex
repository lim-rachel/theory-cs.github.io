At this point, we've seen the proof strategies
\begin{multicols}{2}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item A {\bf counterexample} to prove that  $\forall x P(x)$ is {\bf false}.
        \item  A {\bf witness} to prove that  $\exists x P(x)$ is {\bf true}.
        \item {\bf Proof of universal by exhaustion} to prove that $\forall x \, P(x)$
    is true when $P$ has a finite domain
        \item  {\bf Proof by universal generalization} to prove that $\forall x \, P(x)$
    is true using an arbitrary element of the domain.
        \item To  prove  that $\exists x P(x)$ is {\bf false}, write the universal statement that is 
        logically equivalent to its negation and then prove it true using universal generalization.
        \item To prove that $p \land q$ is true, have two subgoals: 
        subgoal (1) prove $p$ is  true; and, subgoal (2) prove $q$ is true. To prove that $p \land q$ is false, it's enough to prove that $p$ is false.
     To prove that $p \land q$ is false, it's enough to prove that $q$ is false.
        \item Proof of conditional by {\bf direct proof}
        \item Proof of conditional by {\bf contrapositive proof}
        \item Proof of disjuction using equivalent conditional: To prove that the 
        disjunction $p \lor q$ is true, we can rewrite it equivalently as $\lnot p \to q$ and
        then use direct proof or contrapositive proof.
        \item {\bf Proof by cases}.
    \end{itemize}
